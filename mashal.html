            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>We are a group of young professionals who are passionate about enabling young members of our society to live up to their full potential. </p>

            <p>In January 2019 we took the initiative to form MASHAL with the aim of connecting high schools students with mentors.</p>

            <p>These mentors would draw from their personal experiences to counsel the mentees on the best possible ways and methods to overcome hindrances to them realising their full potential. </p>

            <p>Our desire to counsel and aid these students stems from our own respective pasts. As teenagers and high school students, we faced a number of academic and social challenges. We now wish to employ the invaluable lessons we have learnt over the years, to the benefit to the young members of our society. We do this with the intention of shaping our society’s future, by contributing to the present. </p>

            <p>We believe that every young person is capable of achieving amazing things, but it can be very hard to know where to aim when you don’t know what’s out there. Our desire to support and build a generation of confident and ambitious students stems from our own respective pasts. All teenagers and high school students face a number of academic and social challenges, but not all have a trusted mentor that they can turn to for advice. We wish to employ the invaluable lessons we have learnt over the years, and benefit the young members of our society</p>

            <h3>OUR SOLUTION:</h3>

            <p>Many children in Pakistan struggle with societal barriers and face adversities in their lives like detrimental living conditions, family violence, risk factors for mental health, school issues and identity challenges.</p>

            <p>These circumstances have nothing to do with the value of who they are or who they can become, but because of these situations, children and youth risk not having the opportunity to live up to their full potential.
            </p>

            <p>Even worse is the possibility of continuing cycles of developing mental health issues. This comes at a cost to the young person, and to society.
            </p>

            <p>With the guidance and support of a mentor, these risks can be reduced or even avoided, and youth are reminded they can be anything they dream of being.</p>

            <h3>WHAT WE DO:</h3>
            <h5>WE CHANGE LIVES</h5>

            <P>THE COST OF DOING NOTHING:</P>
            <ul>
                <li>Many young people find themselves in vulnerable situations and facing adversities such as mental health issues, family violence, identity issues or poor living conditions, which put these youth at risk of not reaching their full potential.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PAVING THE WAY TO SUCCESS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the guidance and support of a mentor, these risks can be avoided, and these young people can gain the confidence to achieve more – happier lives, more contributions to their communities.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>THE CONFIDENCE TO ACHIEVE MORE:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our mentors advice and challenge these young people, act as their champions, provide greater consistency in their lives, connect them to broader experiences, opportunities and networks, and provide safe, nonjudgmental environments in which the child can confide anything.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>
                HOW WE DO IT?
            </h4>
            <p>MASHAL creates individual mentoring relationships amongst young adults and youth.
Mentorship is a two-way, learning and development partnership where the young person’s needs are placed at the centre.
</p>
       <p>Because young people’s minds are still developing, mentoring can support that process through back-and-forth interaction.</p>
       <p>Mentoring is an important way to give youth experience with these essential back-and-forth relationships, developing them into healthy young individuals who are better able to deal with and overcome life’s adversities.
